2024 is finally here! To ring in the new year, I finally completed something I've been working on
for many months now...


<div class="d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center my-4">
  <div class="border border-top border-2 border-primary-subtle mb-3 w-75"></div>
  <img alt="CS50 Certificate congratulating Daniel Fletcher on completion of CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python"

  <div class="border border-bottom border-2 border-primary-subtle mt-3 w-75"></div>
</div>

After starting this past summer, I have now successfully finished CS50's Introduction to Programming
with Python course. CS50P was an absolute joyride of a course that I learned so much from. I'm very
much looking forward to wrapping up CS50x in the next month or so, and to (hopefully) taking more
CS50 courses throughout 2024.

With the completion of CS50P, though, I worked on a final project that I am quite proud of. Proudly
presenting...

(insert image here)

**color50** is a custom Python package I developed to offer more options for printing in color at the
command line. Working on this project took me across all sorts of in-depth rabbit holes, from writing
Sphinx-style documentation to working with PyPI and TestPyPI. I am very happy with how it turned out!
