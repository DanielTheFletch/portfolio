<!-- Description and details -->
<section class="container main-section">
  <h2 class="site-heading">Project Details</h2>
  <p class="site-subheading">{{ page.desc }}</p>
  <p>In a way, this was my portfolio before my portfolio. This certification project from freeCodeCamp called for developing a portfolio page, and I decided to focus the content of that portfolio on the freeCodeCamp work I had completed up to that point. It seemed like a fitting send-off for the first certification course in the curriculum.</p>
  <p>While this project was not necessarily a precursor to my current portfolio, there are some noteworthy similarities, like the style and presentation of the contact info sections. It's also interesting to me how the <span class="fw-bold">Related Projects</span> section of this page (see below) is essentially a simplified version of that entire project. Funny how things turn out sometimes.</p>
