<!-- Description and details -->
<section class="container main-section">
  <h2 class="site-heading">Project Details</h2>
  <p class="site-subheading">{{ page.desc }}</p>
  <p>This faux online merch store is loosely based around the anime series <span class="fst-italic">Attack on Titan</span>, featuring details related to its world and characters. I found the idea of designing a product landing page for various fictional gadgets to be an intriguing one. I also thought using the world of <span class="fst-italic">Attack on Titan</span> in particular would create somewhat of an absurd juxtaposition, if only because of how far removed the internet (let alone eCommerce) is from that story.</p>
  <p class="text-primary-emphasis"><span class="fw-bold">Please Note:</span> There is an embedded video on the page with content warnings for both <span class="fw-bold">violence</span> and <span class="fw-bold">swearing</span>. Watch at your own discretion.</p>
