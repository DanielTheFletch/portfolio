<!-- Description and details -->

  <h2 class="site-heading">Project Details</h2>
  <p class="site-subheading">{{ page.desc }}</p>
  <p>The final project in this freeCodeCamp certification track is a little more involved than the other four. In accordance with the specifications, I implemented a series of algorithms in JavaScript to calculate a valid amount of change for some cash transaction. A price, cash payment amount, and cash register balance are expected as input.</p>
  <p>The CodePen link above will open an in-browser code editor and console. Tinkering at the console will enable you to interface with the&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>checkCashRegister</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;function I implemented. Note that all other functions are designed as helper functions and are therefore not expected to be called directly.</p>
