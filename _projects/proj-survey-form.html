  <p>Even though I picked up some HTML here and there during my university studies, it wasn't until this freeCodeCamp project that I truly started to hone my web development skills. This was my first ever project working with the likes of HTML and CSS, and it's been quite the journey since then!</p>
  <p>In the survey, you'll answer opinionated questions regarding the 2023 video game <span class="fst-italic">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</span> from Nintendo. The game had recently released around the time of working on this project, and I was having such a good time with it that I wanted to incorporate it into my project work.</p>
