  <p>My first ever submission for <a class="external-link" href="">Harvard University's amazing CS50 program</a>... somehow, I'm already nostalgic for it.</p>
  <p>For my Problem Set 0 submission in the CS50x course, I wanted to challenge myself to create something beyond the basics of the requirements. With extensive prior programming experience under my belt, I figured that some additional complexity could result in a more creatively-satisfying project. After lots of experimenting and tinkering in Scratch, I finally landed on the idea of RGB Defender: A microgame where the player must defend from three types of colorful paint blobs&mdash;red, green, and blue&mdash;that each behave differently.</p>
  <p>This project <span class="fst-italic">also</span> represents my first hands-on experience in solo game development! Even though the Scratch visual programming language is intended for more base-level projects, I enjoyed trying to push the language to its limits while working to achieve the desired player experience.</p>
  <p>Give it a try, and see if you can crack a perfect 100% score!</p>
