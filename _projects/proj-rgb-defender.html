<!-- Description and details -->
<p class="fs-5 fw-light">{{ page.desc }}</p>
<p>For my Problem Set 0 submission in Harvard University's CS50x course, I wanted to challenge myself to create something beyond the basics of what was required. With extensive prior programming experience under my belt, I figured that extra challenge would result in a more creatively-satisfying project. After lots of experimenting, I finally landed on the idea of RGB Defender, a microgame about defending a spaceship from colorful blobs of paint.</p>
<p>This project represents my first hands-on experience in solo game development. Even though the Scratch visual programming language is intended to serve as more of an introduction to the world of programming, I enjoyed trying to push the language to its limits while working to achieve a fun player experience.</p>
<p>Give it a try, and see if you can crack a perfect 100% score!</p>
