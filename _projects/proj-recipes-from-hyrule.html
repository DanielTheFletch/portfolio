  <p>The Odin Project places immense focus on working in your own environment and overcoming any related logistical hurdles. For my first project, I felt that this should be the main focus&mdash;I had never worked with Git before, and I already had prior HTML/CSS experience from freeCodeCamp certifications.</p>
  {% assign survey_form_project = site.projects | find: "title", "Survey Form" %}
  <p>That said, I still ended up with a website that I like! I incorporated content from <span class="fst-italic">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</span> (wait... <a class="external-link" href={{ survey_form_project.url | relative_url }}>haven't I done that before</a>?) to devise a simple recipe index, featuring three in-game recipes.</p>
