  <p>For this project, I really wanted to learn the ins and outs of the CSS Flexbox model. Even though I have learned it multiple times now, sometimes the finer details can get a bit tricky. This time around, though, I had a trick of my own up my sleeve. In addition to studying the very insightful content in The Odin Project's curriculum, I also played through the fantastic online game <a class="external-link" href="https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/">Flexbox Zombies</a> in an effort to reinforce the learning through play.</p>
  <p>And dare I say, I think that strategy paid off in spades! I love the way the project turned out, both aesthetically and in concept. I now feel much more in control of Flexbox layouts than I did previously. Being able to pinpoint why certain things are behaving in ways I did not intend is gradually becoming more natural. On top of all that, I also got the opportunity to make a bunch of computer science puns, so that's always a plus.</p>
