  <p>C++ is easily among my most-practiced programming languages. Since C++ as a language was far too broad for the scope of this project, I wanted to use C++ as a means of presenting some other concept. I eventually landed on the topic of sorting algorithms!</p>
  <p>Sorting algorithms have always been a personal fascination of mine, especially when it comes to comparing them against one another. In this brief set of documentation, you'll find explanations of six different sorting methods with corresponding C++ code examples, complete with a comparison table that breaks down algorithm characteristics like time and space complexity.</p>
  <p>It is worth noting that I did not write the majority of the documentation content&mdash;rather, I focused on piecing together outside content to make a cohesive final product, which was the goal of the project. See below for source documentation references, or see the bottom of the documentation page itself for a more comprehensive listing.</p>
