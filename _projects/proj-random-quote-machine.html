<!-- Description and details -->

  <h2 class="site-heading">Project Details</h2>
  <p class="site-subheading">{{ page.desc }}</p>
  <p>This project was a turning point for me during the freeCodeCamp curriculum. Working with a front-end library like React (as opposed to pure HTML/CSS designs or JavaScript console programming) gave me much better insight into what professional web development can look like. I very much enjoyed working on this one, and I think part of that is because I enjoy working with React!</p>
  <p>I did also enjoy scouring the web for quotes from pop culture. The project specifications did not require any specific quote pool to be used, so I thought I would make it contain quotes from an array of fictional characters that I could hand-pick. I even decided to add supplemental images for each character's quote as a handy reference.</p>
