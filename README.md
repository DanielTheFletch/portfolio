## My portfolio, at a glance

My portfolio website is divided into six main sections:

- **[Certifications](#)** &ndash; Check out all of the certifications I have earned so far in my computer science journey, complete with links to the certifications themselves.
- **[Profiles](#)** &ndash; Interested in my online presence beyond my primary contact info? Look no further! All of my relevant online profiles are listed here, along with an indication as to whether I am currently active for each profile.
- **[Projects](#)** &ndash; Take a look at the myriad of projects I have worked on, ranging from academic submissions for Harvard to personal passion projects. This page contains a rotating selection of three featured projects and a comprehensive list of all my past projects.
