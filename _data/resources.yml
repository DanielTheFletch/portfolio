    blurb: "Harvard University's one-of-a-kind introduction to computer science course taught by professor David J. Malan, as well as many offshoot courses offered under the CS50 umbrella. The online course offerings are completely free to enroll in (seriously), and they offer an unparalleled learning experience for computer science newcomers and veterans alike. I am currently working on my final projects for CS50x and CS50P, and I hope to enroll in more CS50 courses come 2024!"
