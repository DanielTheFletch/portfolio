      <p>My name is Daniel Fletcher, and I have lived in Tallahassee, FL since I was born. In my 22 years in the city, I have met all sorts of amazing people while learning some incredible information. In 2015, I began attending Leon High School, where I would meet classmates and teachers alike that I still talk to to this day. When graduation time came along, I ended up as one of two students to give a speech to the Leon Class of 2019. After graduating, I promptly attended Florida State University where I attained a degree in computer science. In December 2022, I graduated from FSU with a Bachelor of Science degree.</p>
      <p>My relationship with learning extends beyond the classroom. I have always enjoyed learning, especially researching and self-teaching topics of interest. This mindset encouraged me to continue learning more about computer science long after attaining my degree, which is why I have been hard at work finding resources and working on projects over the past many months. I have learned concepts and applied skills regarding web development, game development, relational databases, and so much more. This portfolio is, in fact, a direct result of the learning endeavor! Despite having graduated from FSU almost a year ago at this point, my learning journey is far from over! In fact, I'd say it's just getting started.</p>  
      <p>Growing up, I always enjoyed math and logic, as well as a fascination with video games. Oftentimes, I would find myself trying to combine the two to cook up video games of my own. I can remember designing, developing, and implementing custom game modes in Minecraft using redstone and command-block logic as far back as middle school. It wasn't until more recently, however, that I really started to see the breadth of what the game development community has to offer. Whether it be a time-sucking AAA juggernaut or a short-and-sweet independent game or anything in between, the video gaming space consists of so much variety. This is when I truly became fascinated with game development.</p>
