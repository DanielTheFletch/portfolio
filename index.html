      <p>Hello, World!</p>
      <p>My name is Daniel Fletcher, and I have lived in Tallahassee, FL since I was born. That's <span class="fst-italic">almost</span> 23 years of making friends, fostering connections, and discovering a sense of self. I began attending Leon High School in August 2015, where I would meet classmates and teachers alike that have changed my life for the better. Four school years later in May 2019, I served as one of two seniors to give a speech at the Leon Class of 2019 graduation ceremony.</p>
      <p>Growing up, I always had this deep-rooted sense of wonder associated with mathematics and logic. Partway through my first semester at Florida State University, I came to discover just how much coding scratched this same itch. And thus, a trajectory was born! I declared my major in computer science in January 2020, and I became absolutely enraptured in the vast sea of information the field has to offer. Finally, in December 2022, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science!</p>
      <p>My relationship with learning extends beyond the confines of the classroom, though. Since attaining my degree, I have embarked on several fascinating deep dives and academic pursuits, including the likes of web development certifications, self-directed studies in game development, and even Harvard University's proprietary CS50 program. This portfolio is actually a direct result of some of these learning endeavors! All that's to say, my learning journey is far from over. On the contrary: It's just getting started.</p>
